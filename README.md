# Animals
A simple program in VB.NET to teach kids animals pictures, sounds, and names in English and Arabic language.

Note that you need to unzip the Animals.zip file inside the Animal folder which contains all the animals pictures and sounds. I couldn't leave them uncompressed because the number of files are > 100 which Github doesn't accept.
